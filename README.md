<h1>🌐 MutillidaeII.HomeLab: Exploring Web Vulnerabilities</h1>

<p>This repository is your guide to setting up and using <strong>OWASP Mutillidae II</strong> in a home lab environment. Mutillidae II is a deliberately vulnerable web application, making it an excellent resource for learning about common web security flaws and practicing penetration testing techniques safely.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide clear, step-by-step instructions and configurations to help you build your own hands-on lab, enabling you to explore, exploit, and understand web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, Broken Authentication, and many others, all in a controlled setting.</p>

<h2>🎯 What You'll Find Here:</h2>
